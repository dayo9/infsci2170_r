yes it is field since it has an additive identity which is ‘a’  and it has a multiplicative identity which is ‘b’

Multiplicative for field is

Proof for multiplicative associative and commutative, etc.


S is closed under ‘+’ and ‘*’

(a+b)=(b+a) & (a+b)+c=a+(b+c) for a,b

As a+a=a, b+a=b, then a is the additive identity

As a+a=a, b+b=a, then the additive inverse is themselves for a,



(a*b)*a = a*(b*a)

As a*b=a,b*b=b, then b is the multiplicative identity

a*(b+c) = (a*b)+(a*c) = (b+c)*a for a,b(c can be a/b)

Thus, S is a ring.

As the multiplicative identity is b, a is the additive identity, and b*b = b, then except the

additive identity, other element in S has their multiplicative inverse. Thus, S is a field
